ef6-vs-dapper
=============

Sample code to test speed of EF6 vs Dapper.

Works against the [AdventureWorks2012 database](http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/55330) on a 
local instance called SQLExpress. To change this for the EF portion, modify the app.config in the test project.
For the Dapper portion, modify the connection string in the DapperDriver file.
